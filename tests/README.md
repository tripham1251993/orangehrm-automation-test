## Page Object Model Architecture

### BasePage

The framework implements the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern with a `BasePage` class as the foundation. The `BasePage` class:

- Serves as an abstract base class that all page objects inherit from
- Provides common functionality shared across all pages
- Handles common operations like waiting for elements to be editable
- Enforces a consistent structure through abstract methods that child classes must implement
- Centralizes page interaction logic for better maintainability

Key features of the `BasePage` class:
- Manages the Playwright `Page` object
- Provides waitForPageLoaded abstract method that each page must implement
- Includes utility methods for element interactions
- Simplifies test maintenance by isolating UI changes to page objects

All specific page object classes (like `HomePage`, `GlobalMenu`, etc.) extend this base class and implement their own page-specific functionality while inheriting the common behavior.

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/tripham1251993/orangehrm-automation-test.git
cd orangehrm-automation-test
```

1. Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

3. Install Playwright browsers:

```
npx playwright install
```

4. Optional: Create a `.env` file in the tests directory for environment configuration:

```
BASE_URL=https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com
```

## Test Execution Commands

### API Tests

**Local / CI Execution:**

```
npm run test:api
```

**Running API tests with specific tags:**

```
npm run test:api -- -g "@api"
npm run test:api -- -g "@api-regression"
npm run test:api -- -g "@api-employees"
```

### E2E Tests

**Local Execution (with browser UI):**

```
npm run test:e2e-chromium
npm run test:e2e-firefox
```

**CI Execution (headless mode):**

```
npm run test:e2e-chromium:ci
npm run test:e2e-firefox:ci
```

**Running E2E tests with specific tags:**

```
npm run test:e2e-chromium -- -g "@login"
npm run test:e2e-firefox -- -g "@dashboard"
```

## Reporting

**Generate and serve Allure report:**

```
npm run serve-report
```

This command will start a local web server and open the Allure report in your default browser.

## Additional Commands

**Code formatting:**

```
npm run format:check  # Check for formatting issues
npm run format:fix    # Fix formatting issues automatically
```

**Linting:**

```
npm run lint:check    # Check for linting issues
npm run lint:fix      # Fix linting issues automatically
```

## In CI

The tests are configured to run automatically in GitHub Actions when:

- Changes are pushed to main/master branch in the `tests/api` or `tests/e2e` or `pageObjects` directory
- Changes are made to the CI workflow files
- Manually triggered via GitHub Actions
